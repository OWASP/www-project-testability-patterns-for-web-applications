## More secure web applications with privacy incorporated
The application of standard business practices to building software applications is advancing rapidly to meet the evolving needs of web-based application software powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The EU-funded TESTABLE project proposes a software development lifecycle (SDLC) that combines two metrics to quantify the security and privacy risks of a program: the code testability and vulnerable behaviour indicators. TESTABLE will empower software/AI developers, managers, testers, and auditors to reduce the risk by building better security and privacy testing techniques for web applications and removing or mitigating the impact of the patterns causing the high-risk levels. It will develop algorithms, techniques, and tools to analyse, test, and study web applications.

# OWASP  Testability Patterns for Web Applications
OWASP TESTABLE redefines the classical secure development life-cycle around the concept of testability, providing new tools for:
- Web and AI/ML Developers
- Managers
- Security Teams

title: This is the title of your project or chapter page, usually the name.  For example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy or OWASP Baltimore
## Objective
The OWASP project aims to deliver tools and methodologies for:
- Managers: New metric quantifying the security and privacy risks of a program.
- Developers: Better and flexible tools to improve testability, reducing security and privacy risk exposure.
- Security teams: Better and more flexible security, privacy testing, and AI/ML tools.

## Plan

tags: This is a space-delimited list of tags you associate with your project or chapter.  If you are using tabs, at least one of these tags should be unique in order to be used in the tabs files (an example tab is included in this repo) 

level: For projects, this is your project level (2 - Incubator, 3 - Lab, 4 - Flagship)

type: code, tool, documentation, or other
