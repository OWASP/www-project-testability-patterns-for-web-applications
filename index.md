## More secure web applications with privacy incorporated
The application of standard business practices to building software applications is advancing rapidly to meet the evolving needs of web-based application software powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The EU-funded TESTABLE project proposes a software development lifecycle (SDLC) that combines two metrics to quantify the security and privacy risks of a program: the code testability and vulnerable behaviour indicators. TESTABLE will empower software/AI developers, managers, testers, and auditors to reduce the risk by building better security and privacy testing techniques for web applications and removing or mitigating the impact of the patterns causing the high-risk levels. It will develop algorithms, techniques, and tools to analyse, test, and study web applications.

# OWASP  Testability Patterns for Web Applications
OWASP TESTABLE redefines the classical secure development life-cycle around the concept of testability, providing new tools for:
- Web and AI/ML Developers
- Managers
- Security Teams

## Objective
The OWASP project aims to deliver tools and methodologies for:
- Managers: New metric quantifying the security and privacy risks of a program.
- Developers: Better and flexible tools to improve testability, reducing security and privacy risk exposure.
- Security teams: Better and more flexible security, privacy testing, and AI/ML tools.
